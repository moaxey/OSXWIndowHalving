OSX Window Halving
==================

Developing or creating digital content usually involves working between two or
more windows and that is something which OSX does not cater to as easily as
Linux or Windows. Sure you can drag and resize many windows into an arrangement
which suits your current task, but they do inevitable pop up in an inconvenient
place the first time and often different tasks mean more unproductive time
rearranging your workspace.

This project provides a script and Automator workflows to do some common window
resizing tasks via keyboard shortcuts or the application Services menu item.

-   Window to full screen

-   Move window to left or right of the current screen

-   Move window and resize it to half the screen width

This project is not perfect
---------------------------

-   Some applications don't expose their windows to AppleScript (like
    LibreOffice) and won't work.

-   Application's keyboard shortcuts override system-wide shortcuts.
